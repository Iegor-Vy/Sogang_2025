# Course Objectives:

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- **Visualize Economic Relationships** – Use graphs and functions to understand market behavior and economic trends.

- **Solve Real-World Problems** – Apply linear and nonlinear equations to supply &amp; demand, pricing, and investment scenarios.

- **Analyze Marginal Changes** – Use differentiation to understand rates of change in revenue, cost, and economic indicators.

- **Optimize Economic Decisions** – Maximize profits and minimize costs using comparative statics and partial differentiation.

- **Model Economic Growth** – Apply integration to analyze accumulation and economic modeling.

- **Solve Complex Systems** – Use matrix algebra to analyze interdependent economic relationships and policy effects.

- **Think Mathematically** – Develop logical reasoning and problem-solving skills applicable across economics, finance, and business.

- In-class lecture plus in-class activities

- Post-class problem set (5 to 10 short questions)

- Support sessions before quizzes and exams

---

# Course materials:

- **Lecture notes**

- Jacques, Ian (2023) **Mathematics for Economics and Business**, 10th ed., Pearson. Any previous edition would be also fine.

# Study Suggestions 

1. Reading materials before class 

2. Participate (10% of your grade) and ask questions.

3. Be active in class (don't miss and do in-class activities)

4. "The best way to learn ... is to stay on top of it as you go along. The worst way is to cram the night before exams." (c)

# 1. Lack of Interest

- Great indifference 

- Missing lectures

- Coming/leaving late/early

- No in-class activities

- Doing something else in class

- Cheating / free riding

# 2. Language Barrier

- Trouble with listening/reading comprehension 

- Poor vocabulary

- Hard time with new terminology


**.blue[It's okay, just push harder]**

No worries; it's not a language class.

# What does international commerce measure every day?

- Exchange rates and returns

- Price differences across countries

- Shipping and logistics costs

- Tariffs, taxes, and final consumer price

- Demand responses (elasticity)

- Risk (hedging and diversification)


---

# Why study Mathematical Methods for International Commerce?

- *Clarity &amp; Precision* – Translates complex economic concepts into rigorous, logical models that eliminate ambiguity.

- *Better Decision-Making* – Helps analyze and solve real-world economic problems.

- *Stronger Analytical Skills* – Enhances problem-solving and critical thinking.

- *Career Advantage* – Essential for finance, business, policy analysis, and research.

- *Foundation for Advanced Studies* – Prepares for econometrics, optimization, and economic theory.

---

# Example 1: Exchange rate pass-through in one picture?

**Simple Example:**

If a product costs $100 USD and the exchange rate changes from 1,200 to 1,350 KRW/USD:

- Old price: $100 × 1,200 = 120,000 KRW
- New price: $100 × 1,350 = 135,000 KRW  
- Price increase: 15,000 KRW or 12.5% increase in KRW price.

**The Math:** `\(P_{KRW} = P_{USD} \times E_{rate}\)`
