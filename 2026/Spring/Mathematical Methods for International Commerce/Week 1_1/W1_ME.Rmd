# 2. Course Overview

---

# Course Description:

- **Designed for Incoming Students**: Builds essential mathematical foundations needed for success in international economics, business, and financial studies.

- **Core Topics Covered**: Introductory algebra, differentiation, matrix analysis, and optimization—building a strong foundation for analytical decision-making in the global economy.  

- **Applied Focus**: Emphasizes practical problem-solving and economic applications over abstract mathematical theory.

- **Engaging Approach**: Demonstrates that mathematics is both a powerful analytical tool and genuinely enjoyable to learn.

---

# Course Objectives:

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- **Visualize Economic Relationships** – Use graphs and functions to understand market behavior and economic trends.

- **Solve Real-World Problems** – Apply linear and nonlinear equations to supply & demand, pricing, and investment scenarios.

- **Analyze Marginal Changes** – Use differentiation to understand rates of change in revenue, cost, and economic indicators.

- **Optimize Economic Decisions** – Maximize profits and minimize costs using comparative statics and partial differentiation.

- **Model Economic Growth** – Apply integration to analyze accumulation and economic modeling.

- **Solve Complex Systems** – Use matrix algebra to analyze interdependent economic relationships and policy effects.

- **Think Mathematically** – Develop logical reasoning and problem-solving skills applicable across economics, finance, and business.

---

# The Course in a Nutshell

- **Mathematical Foundations** – Learn the essential math skills needed for economics.  

- **Hands-On Learning** – Apply concepts through class activities and home assignments. 

- **Supportive Environment** – A safe space to ask questions, discuss, and learn from mistakes.

- In-class lecture plus in-class activities

- Post-class problem set (5 to 10 short questions)

- Support sessions before quizzes and exams

---

# Course materials:

# 3. Personal Challenges

- Health 

- Family

- Job

- Universe against you


**.red[Come talk to me ASAP]**

---

# 4. Math Anxiety / PTSD

# What does international commerce measure every day?

- Exchange rates and returns

- Price differences across countries

- Shipping and logistics costs

- Tariffs, taxes, and final consumer price

- Demand responses (elasticity)

- Risk (hedging and diversification)


---

# Why study Mathematical Methods for International Commerce?

- *Clarity & Precision* – Translates complex economic concepts into rigorous, logical models that eliminate ambiguity.

- *Better Decision-Making* – Helps analyze and solve real-world economic problems.

- *Stronger Analytical Skills* – Enhances problem-solving and critical thinking.

- *Career Advantage* – Essential for finance, business, policy analysis, and research.

- *Foundation for Advanced Studies* – Prepares for econometrics, optimization, and economic theory.

---

# Example 1: Exchange rate pass-through in one picture?

**Simple Example:**

If a product costs $100 USD and the exchange rate changes from 1,200 to 1,350 KRW/USD:

- Old price: $100 × 1,200 = 120,000 KRW
- New price: $100 × 1,350 = 135,000 KRW  
- Price increase: 15,000 KRW or 12.5% increase in KRW price.

**The Math:** $P_{KRW} = P_{USD} \times E_{rate}$
