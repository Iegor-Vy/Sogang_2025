Hello everyone!

I am *Iegor Vyshnevskyi*, your instructor for **Statistics for International Commerce**.

I hope you are **excited** to start this journey into the *world of statistics and economics*!

# Icebreaker  
## How Wrong Can Humans Be?

---

# Quick Poll (No Phones Yet)

Which of the following do you think is TRUE?

  A) More people die each year from shark attacks than from vending machines.  

  B) Most international trade happens between rich and poor countries.  

  C) Small exchange rate changes (1–2%) never matter for firms.  

  D) Countries with higher GDP always have higher living standards.

Raise your hand for your answer.

---

# Reality Check

A) False – vending machines are statistically more dangerous than sharks.  

B) False – most trade happens between developed economies.  

C) False – small % changes can have huge profit effects.  

D) False – GDP per capita ≠ distribution, inequality matters.

Lesson:
*Our intuition is often wrong.*

**That is why we need statistics.**

---

class: center, middle

# Mini-Game  
## Guess the Number

---

# Guess the Number

Without Googling/AI:

  1) What percentage of global trade is services?  

  2) What percentage of world trade involves global value chains?  

  3) What is the average tariff rate globally?

Write your guesses.

We will revisit these later in the semester.

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Why This Matters

If your guess is far from reality,  
that is not a failure.

That is the starting point of learning.

Statistics reduces the gap between:
what we think  
and what the data says.

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Final Icebreaker Question

Which best describes you?

1) “I love numbers.” 

2) “I tolerate numbers.”  

3) “Numbers tolerate me.” 

4) “I survived math. Barely.”

Be honest.

**This course is designed for all four types.**

# 3. How we will learn

---

# Course format

* Flipped and applied learning approach:

  * Short prep materials before class
  * Class time for discussion, interpretation, coding demos, and hands-on problem solving

* Real economic and business datasets are used throughout

* Emphasis on understanding concepts and interpretation, not just formulas

* Safe space for questions and learning from mistakes


---

# Course materials

1. **Required / Core Reference:**
  - Douglas Lind, William Marchal, Samuel Wathen. *Statistical Techniques in Business and Economics*, 16th ed. (LMW)

2. **Supplementary Resources:**
  - James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Taylor, J. (2023). *An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in Python* (ISLP). Available at https://www.statlearning.com/
  - James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Taylor, J. (2013). *An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R* (ISLR). Available at https://www.statlearning.com/

3. **Online Platforms:**
  - DataCamp Classroom (assigned modules)
  - Google Colab (for coding practice)

---

# Tools we will use: Python and DataCamp and LLMs

* Python (primary), or R (allowed option depending on your track)

* DataCamp Classroom:

  * guided practice to build core coding fluency
  * structured exercises aligned with weekly topics

* Large Language Models (LLMs):

  * for brainstorming, debugging, and learning support
  * not for blindly copying code or answers

* Goal: you become independent enough to run analyses without copying code blindly

---

# What “mastering Python” means in this course

You will repeatedly practice:

* Working with datasets (loading, cleaning, selecting variables)

* Describing data (summary statistics, basic plots)

* Probability and simulation intuition (simple experiments with code)

* Inference and regression workflows (estimate, diagnose, interpret)

* Reproducibility habits (clear scripts, documented outputs)

---

# Our Main Coding Interface: Google Colab

We will primarily use **Google Colab**.

Why?

- Runs in your browser (no installation needed)
- Free access to Python environment
- Easy sharing and submission
- Works on any computer

All you need:
- A Google account
- Internet connection
- A laptop

---

# What is Google Colab?

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is an online Jupyter Notebook environment.

It allows you to:

- Write and run Python code  
- Combine text, formulas, and code  
- Visualize data (plots, tables)  
- Save work automatically in Google Drive  

It is widely used in data science and research.

---

# What You Will Do in Colab

In this course, you will:

- Load datasets (CSV, Excel)
- Clean and prepare data
- Compute statistics
- Create visualizations
- Estimate regression models
- Interpret results

Everything will be reproducible.

---

# Can I Use Something Else?

Yes.

You may use:

- VS Code  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- PyCharm  
- RStudio (if using R)

However:
- Support and demonstrations will be done in Colab.
- Your code must run properly when submitted.

---

# Why This Matters

The goal is not just learning statistics.

It is learning to:

- Think analytically  
- Work with real data  
- Produce reproducible analysis  
- Build practical data skills for international commerce

Colab is simply our tool.

# Statistics in International Commerce  
## Let’s Make It Real (and a Bit Fun)

---

# Why International Commerce Needs Statistics

Imagine you work in:

- An exporting company deciding where to expand  

- A multinational firm managing currency risk  

- A government agency evaluating trade policy  

- A logistics company optimizing global supply chains  

All of them rely on data.

Statistics turns raw numbers into decisions.

---

# Example 1: Exchange Rates & Profits

Suppose your company exports to the U.S.

Question:
- If KRW appreciates by 5%, what happens to revenue in KRW?

With statistics, we can:

- Model exchange rate volatility  
- Estimate revenue sensitivity  
- Forecast possible profit scenarios  

Without statistics:
- “Let’s hope the exchange rate behaves.”

---

# Example 2: Market Entry Decision

You are analyzing two countries:

- Country A: higher GDP growth, unstable inflation  
- Country B: stable inflation, slower growth  

Using statistics, you can:

- Compare averages and variability  
- Test whether differences are statistically significant  
- Estimate demand using regression  

This is not math for math’s sake.  
It is structured decision-making under uncertainty.

---

# Example 3: Consumer Data

An international e-commerce platform collects:

- Click data  
- Purchase history  
- Country-level preferences  

Statistics helps to:

- Segment customers  
- Estimate price elasticity  
- Predict demand  

Behind every “recommended for you” section there is probability and regression.

---

# Example 4: Trade Policy Evaluation

Suppose tariffs increase.

We may ask:

- Did imports decrease significantly?  
- Did domestic production increase?  
- Was the effect temporary or persistent?

We use:

- Before-after comparisons  
- Hypothesis testing  
- Regression models  

Statistics helps separate signal from noise.

# Now Let’s Make It Fun

---

# Meme 1: Correlation vs Causation

.pull-left[

.center[
<img src="p1.jpg" width="80%">
]]

.pull-right[
“Correlation does not imply causation.”

Just because two variables move together  
does not mean one causes the other.

In international commerce:
- GDP growth and exports may move together  
But why?

That’s where analysis begins.
]
---

# Meme 2: Forecasting

.center[
<img src="p2.jpg" width="60%">
]

Forecasting be like:

“We predict with 95% confidence that something will happen… unless it doesn’t.”

Statistics does not remove uncertainty.  

It quantifies it.

---

# Meme 3: Regression Be Like

.pull-left[
.center[
<img src="p4.jpg" width="80%">
]]

.pull-right[
Regression students:

“Is this coefficient significant?”

Professor:

“First, tell me what it means economically.”

Numbers without interpretation are useless.
]

---

# Meme 4: Data Cleaning

.pull-left[
.center[
<img src="p3.jpg" width="80%">
]]

.pull-right[
Expectation: glamorous data science.  

Reality: cleaning messy spreadsheets for 3 hours.

In this course:
You will learn that cleaning is 50-80% of real analysis.
]

---

# Quick Interactive Exercise

Think about one international commerce question:

- Why did exports fall last year?  
- What determines foreign direct investment?  
- Does exchange rate volatility reduce trade?  
- Do trade agreements increase bilateral flows?

Now ask:

Which data would you need?  
Which statistical tools might help?

---

# The Big Idea

Statistics is not about formulas.

It is about:

- Making better decisions  
- Understanding global markets  
- Reducing uncertainty  
- Thinking critically  

And yes, sometimes laughing at regression memes.
